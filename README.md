This repository contains the code based on Theano for the paper:

"Bidirectional Recurrent Convolutional Networks for Multi-Frame Super-Resolution." Huang, Yan and Wang, Wei and Wang, Liang
Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems 28.

The code is used for owner private experiment, which the result lower performance than its mentioned in original paper, as a reference.
